## A list of project ideas I have but can't start at the moment

- [ ] Markdown Parser for svelte (already in progress)
  - custom parser (manually enable options)
  - basic parser (standard stuff)
  - advanced parser (+ images, subtext)
  - full parser (+ hints, tables)
  - Discord parser (basic + subtext)

- [ ] Improved spotify embeds (with hono? ðŸ‘€)
  - `Spxtify`: Significantly enhanced experience for embedding Spotify content within Discord, since they are a bit annoying.

- [ ] A service to host privacy policy and tos for private Discord bots that want to be verified and just need a tos and privacy policy.

- [ ] A GitHub template with Sveltekit for static docs gen

- [ ] Timecapsule service for Spotify

- [ ] A discord user bot - a chat gpt wrapper. Where you can interact with messages to let the AI summarize it for you and also sanitize a message it so you can read petty formatting/Gen Z language.
