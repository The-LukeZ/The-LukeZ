## A list of project ideas I have but can't start at the moment

- [ ] Improved spotify embeds (with hono? ðŸ‘€)
  - `Spxtify`: Significantly enhanced experience for embedding Spotify content within Discord, since they are a bit annoying.
- [ ] A service to host privacy policy and tos for private Discord bots that want to be verified and just need a tos and privacy policy.
